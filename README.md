## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use Flexbox to create the layout that was needed. Moreover, I understood css breakpoints to design the site according to screen size.

### Continued development

I want to focus on CSS Grid because because it goes hand-in-hand with Flexbox.
